# BasicNetworkSecurity
This is a set of basic network security tasks!

Here we have a very simple network, comrprising of a switch, router, and 3 PC's. 
On this network I will be applying MD5 hash (level 5) encrypted passwords, and scrypt encrypted (level 9) passwords.

As you can see, sometimes type 9 passwords or passwords made with the scrypt hash algorithm aren't an option, so you need to use MD5 Hash.
I have one example of each, type 9 scrypt, is the more secure, it is computationally intensive and resistant to brute-force attacks compared to the MD5 algorithm used by Type 5.
