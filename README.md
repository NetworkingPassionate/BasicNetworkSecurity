This is a set of basic network security tasks!

On this network I will be applying MD5 hash (level 5) encrypted passwords, and scrypt encrypted (level 9) passwords.

Sometimes type 9 passwords or passwords made with the scrypt hash algorithm aren't an option, so you need to use MD5 Hash.
I have one example of each, type 9 scrypt, is the more secure, it is computationally intensive and resistant to brute-force attacks compared to the MD5 algorithm used by Type 5.
