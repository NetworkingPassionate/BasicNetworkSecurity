üîê Password Security Demonstration: Type 5 (MD5) vs Type 9 (scrypt)
This network lab includes hands-on demonstrations of two Cisco password encryption schemes:
- Type 5: Legacy MD5-based hashing
- Type 9: Modern scrypt-based hashing, offering stronger resistance to brute-force attacks

Both methods are used to secure local passwords on Cisco devices, depending on hardware and IOS version compatibility.
üí° Why Use Type 9?
Where supported, Type 9 (scrypt) should always be preferred:
- Designed for password hardening
- Computationally intensive and memory-bound
- Far more resilient against dictionary and brute-force attacks than MD5
However, in some environments ‚Äî such as older IOS versions or constrained hardware ‚Äî Type 9 may not be available. In those cases, Type 5 (MD5) remains a fallback option.
This lab contains one example of each, allowing for comparison of syntax, behavior, and configuration within a simulated network environment.

# VLANS

On my lab we have quite a few devices, and often for efficiency and security, we want to seperate the traffic through the network into different logical segments using VLANs, 
this way only devices on the 'Management' VLAN, receive traffic meant for management, and so forth.

# Port-Security

Port-Security is designed to either **protect**, **restrict** or **shutdown** ports when it detects an unregistered/unauthorised device attempting access via a port. 
Port-Security has 2 modes; sticky, static and dynamic. Each of these settings has different functionalities, depending on how secure you want your device, and how critical distruption of service can be. 


Here in this example we have a basic switch setup, with 2 trusted PCs, and a rogue laptop. The rogue laptop will attempt to gain access to the network via the switch, however, the switch has not learned its MAC address an associated it with one of its ports. 
In this simple lab, MAC Address learning is set to **sticky**, and the violation mode is set to **restrict**. for ports f0/1-2.

Then, when a device tries to connect to one of these ports, the switch will have learned the MAC address of the authorised device depending on the MAC address learning method, and it will go in it's MAC address table. When the new device is connected to this port, the switch will compare this device to it's MAC address, and if the entries don't match, it will act depending on the violation mode it is set to. In this case, **Restrict**
