# BasicNetworkSecurity

This is a set of basic network security tasks!

# Passwords
On this network I will be applying MD5 hash (level 5) encrypted passwords, and scrypt encrypted (level 9) passwords.

Sometimes type 9 passwords or passwords made with the scrypt hash algorithm aren't an option, so you need to use MD5 Hash.
I have one example of each, type 9 scrypt, is the more secure, it is computationally intensive and resistant to brute-force attacks compared to the MD5 algorithm used by Type 5. So whenever given the chance, use type 9.

# VLANS

On my lab we have quite a few devices, and often for efficiency and security, we want to seperate the traffic through the network into different VLANs, 
this way only devices on the 'Management' VLAN, receive traffic meant for management, and so forth.
